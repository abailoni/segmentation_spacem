    "- Neuroglancer is a software to visualize 3d data and segmentations, and in this case all datasets/segmentations are stacked along a 3rd dimension, so we only care about looking data across xy dimensions (not across xz or yz).\n",
    "- By default in neuroglancer you see all three views, but you can maximize the xy view to the full screen and ignore the other ones (usually the quadrant on the bottom-right).\n",
    "- By scrolling with your mouse, you can move through the third dimension (moving from one dataset to the next one). Instead, with Ctrl+Scroll you can zoom in and out.\n",
    "- Layers are listed on the top-left of the interface. If you re-run the second cell of this notebook, microscopy layers will be updated in the viewer. If you instead re-run the third cell, you will update the segmentation layers. \n",
    "- You can hide or show a layer by clicking on it\n",
    "- By right-clicking on a layer, you open a side-bar on the right: in the `Rendering` tab you find the opacity slider and you can also adjust the contrast of min-max values, similarly to Napari\n",
